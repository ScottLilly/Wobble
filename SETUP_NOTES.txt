Wobble setup instructions
====================================================================
Currently, there is no installer for Wobble - although that is planned.

To run Wobble, you must:
1. Configure the values in Wobble.WPF\appsettings.json (see below)
2. Build the solution with anything that builds a .NET 5/C# solution
	For example, Visual Studio or Visual Code
3. Run the Wobble.WPF.exe that was created in step 2

NOTE:	Wobble is still in development, and it "works on my computer"

Create a Twitch bot user account
====================================================================
Wobble was built using a separate Twitch user account for the bot.
Wobble should work if you use your main account; however, it was built around using a separate bot account.

After creating your Twitch account, get a token to use for the bot.
To get your Twitch token, visit https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication and https://twitchapps.com/tmi/

NOTE: Keep this token secret.


Configuring appsettings.json
====================================================================
Open Wobble.WPF\appsettings.json in a text editor
	Ideally one that understands the JSON format, like Notepad++ https://notepad-plus-plus.org/

Lines 2-6 contain the information about your bot. Replace it with 
    - ChannelName: Twitch channel the bot will connect to, for example "CodingWithScott"
    - BotAccountName: Twitch account the bot is connecting with, for example "codingwithscottbot"
	- TwitchToken: The token you received during the "Create a Twitch bot user account" step above
		NOTE: See below, if you are a developer and want to place this in your user secrets file
    - BotDisplayName: Name to display in chat for bot messages, for example "CodingWithScottBot"
	- HandleHostRaidSubscriptionEvents: true or false, depending on if you want Wobble to do something for hosts/raids/subscriptions


Storing your Twitch token in user secrets
-----------------------------------------------------
For C# developers, you can store your token in user secrets, in the format below.
Wobble will attempt to use the TwitchToken value from appsettings.json first.
If there is no value in appsettings.json, it will look for the value in user secrets.
If there is no TwitchToken in user secrets, the program will currently crash (better error handling is planned)
Create user secrets file with this format:
{
  "TwitchToken": "INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
}


Setting up features in appsettings.json
-----------------------------------------------------
The "WobbleCommands" section shows functions Wobble has built in.
You can turn them on or off by setting their "IsEnabled" to "true" (enabled) or "false" (disabled).

The "ChatMessages" section is for simple responses to chat commands (prefixed by "!")
Each ChatMessage has a TriggerWords array and a "Responses" array.

"TriggerWords" are the words that will cause a response to be written in Twitch chat.
NOTE: TriggerWords values are not case-sensitive.
"Responses" can have one or more values.
If there is only one value, that will always be the response displayed in chat.
If there are multiple values, Wobble will randomly select one to display in chat.

"CounterMessages" are commands that store an incrementing counter that is displayed in the reponse.
The first time a chat user types in a TriggerWords value, a count value is stored in the file CounterData.json.
Before displaying the Response, Wobble will replace the substring "{counter}" with the value from the file for that TriggerWord.
Wobble will then increment the value in CounterData.json, for the next time the TriggerWord is used.

"TimedMessages" are messages or commands that will be displayed on a regular interval.
"IntervalInMinutes" is the number of minutes between displaying a TimedMessage.
"Messages" is an array of responses that will be randomly-selected when the timer fires.
